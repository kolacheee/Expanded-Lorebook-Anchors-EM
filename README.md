## How to Use

### Creating a New Folder

2.  Next to the "New Entry" button, you will see a new folder icon. Click this icon to create a new folder.
3.  A new folder named "New Folder" will appear at the top of your World Info list.

### Renaming a Folder

2.  The text will become editable. Type your desired name and press Enter or click away to save.

### Organizing Entries and Folders

-   **Collapsing/Expanding:** Click anywhere on the folder header (except the name itself when editing) to toggle its content visibility.
-   **Moving Entries into Folders:** Drag any World Info entry and drop it inside an open folder.
-   **Reordering:** Both folders and individual entries can be dragged and dropped to change their order in the list.

## Styling

The folder icon color is designed to match your SillyTavern's "Main Text" color automatically. Other styles are designed to be consistent with the default SillyTavern UI.
